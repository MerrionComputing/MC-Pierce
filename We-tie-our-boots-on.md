**We tie our boots on**

* We tie our boots on at the crack of dawn,
* We deliver and clean in the times in-between,
* We family need clothes, but our hearts are torn,
* We are unheard, ephemeral, nocturnal, and always unseen.

* We tie our boots on before dawn,
* No equity, no share, no return.
* We tie our boots on before dawn,
* Anger within you shall learn.
